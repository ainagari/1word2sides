Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored .
Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the W-region .
At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f .
Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20 % aqueous sodium_iodide solution .
Hence , when the address * * f is computed from * * f , the cell * * f and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether * * f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain .
When the complete file has been read , the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description of the form it represents .
A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm .
The cells were washed three times with saline , anti human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination .
The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .
The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen_out in a side arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distill slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing_off .
The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell * * f .
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm .
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W_region are used for storage of the forms in the text form list ; cells in the X-region and Y_region are reserved as information cells for text forms .
The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen_down and the manifold as_a_whole was sealed_off .
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combines a microscope with a color - TV_system to view the results .
Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent .
Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .
The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence .
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells .
These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon_tetrachloride .
Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .
Paper_electrophoresis was carried_out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on Whatman 3 MM filter_paper .
On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread .
Some of the sinusoids contained large_numbers of nucleated red_cells , and cells of the granulocytic series were found in small numbers .
The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no_longer required .
Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in_spite_of many attempts with black_and_white and color photography .
Such sections showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 ) .
This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells .
By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energies ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases .
In series /1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. .
Microscopically , both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells .
But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter .
If cell * * f is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list .
The address * * f and the number of cells required to store the form are written in * * f ; the information cell * * f is saved to represent the text occurrence .
This method in_general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set .
In_fact agglutination of * * f cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity .
Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell .
Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in_vitro been unequivocally proven .
Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm , while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment .
The intima of the larger coronary_arteries was thickened by fibrous_tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells .
Five milliamperes / cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carried_out using a Spinco_Analytrol .
If cell * * f is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored .
The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as_a_group on the same manifold .
Thus , when more_than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .
The red_cells for the Rh_antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the * * f cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C for approximately 1 year .
The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers .
These cells were thawed at 37 ` C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 % ) .
Only the assignment of the information cells is important .
When an occurrence * * f is isolated during text reading , a random_memory address * * f , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of * * f .
