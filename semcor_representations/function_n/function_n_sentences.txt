Even death , therefore , has a providential as_well_as a punitive function .
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequences .
Today the private_detective will also investigate insurance_claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .
In_spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness .
Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as_well .
In_addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society .
With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences_of_opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion .
Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .
To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words .
For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions .
it might be pointed_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .
Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .
Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite .
MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic_brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related_to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .
In carrying_out his functions under section 2 of_this Act , the Secretary may -
There is hereby authorized to be appropriated , out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated , such sums as may be necessary to enable the Commission to carry_out its functions under this Title .
Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .
The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank .
Nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions .
Sheer plumpness , he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions .
In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution .
The actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by St._Gregory almost a millennium before More wrote Utopia .
There are several closely related inner functions .
In a properly ordered society the massive force of public_law performs the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small_voice so often still .
This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .
The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .
In the third category the function is double valued in this interval .
The relation between osmotic_pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .
We first show that the function is single valued in some neighborhood .
Since * * f are linearly independent functions and the exponential_function has no zeros , these r functions * * f , form a basis for the space of solutions .
When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pairs * * f , is a probability function called a binomial_distribution .
We first define a function b ( t ) as_follows : given the set of squares such_that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b ( t ) is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between t and the backward corner points .
The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of GNP .
We consider now the graph of the function f ( t ) on **f .
If * * f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height is * * f .
The level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate .
A proton_magnetic_resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic_field and temperature is presented .
The number of ordinary values of the function f ( t ) at t will be called its multiplicity at t .
Accordingly , the ' functions ' * * f span the space of solutions of * * f .
In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single valued , analytic function of u .
The values **f are the ordinary values at **f of a multi valued function g ( t ) which has components corresponding to those of f ( t ) .
If * * f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential_equation is a subspace of * * f .
The fact that there can not be any limit_points of the set except in closed_intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and **f are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
Heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electrons impinging_on the anode .
For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and **f must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , **f could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at t is the argument of the function , not a value .
In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a single valued , continuous function .
In the neighborhood of an end_point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two valued or no valued on one side , and is a single valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side .
We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry .
In the second category the function **f has no values defined in a neighborhood **f .
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T .
