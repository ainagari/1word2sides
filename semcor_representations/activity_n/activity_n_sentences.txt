He sucked_in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold wire stems of his glasses around his ears and_then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting_Lieutenant_Gunnar_Matson one failed to see that the station_keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide_Detail of the Inspector's_Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying_on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting_Captain_O._T._Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known_as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he leaned_back and peeled_off his glasses `` - failed to co-operate with the Acting_Captain by returning promptly when so ordered .
The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh_antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect_Coombs techniques .
The more I probed into this young_man 's activities and character , the less savory I found him .
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .

The police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities .
All_of these activities are geared to a top priority communication_system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .
There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti - A and anti - B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J._F. and E._M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) .
Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid_gland .
At the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism TSH acts_on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f .
On_the_other_hand , there are a_few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine .
Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .
Stimulates rumen activity .
Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges .
The introduction of the United_States_Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid stimulating activity have made_it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time .
The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity .
In all cases the activity against * * f cells was spread over a wider area than that with * * f cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect_Coombs ) used for comparison .
Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh_antibody activity were generally continuous and wide .
We should_like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in_terms_of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units .
This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal_to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected .
The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per_cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .
The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .
When the temperature reached 32 ` F all protozoan activity ceased ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly .
In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) .
Once_again , both anti - A and anti - B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis .
When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P._J. and R._S. , Fig. 1 and E._M. , Fig. 2 ) .
This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at_all .
The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) .
As_expected , most of the activity was found in Fraction * * f , with slight activity seen in Fraction 4 , - 1 .
The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance .
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .
